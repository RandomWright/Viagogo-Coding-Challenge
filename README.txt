This program accepts the user location and returns the closest five events from a list of sample events. The location of these events are randomly generated in this program to be between -10 & +10 on the world. This example takes into account the fact that there could be no tickets left at an event but does not have a time of the event. This assumes all the events are now. This program allows for multiple events at the same location but it would be interesting to sort the events at the same place based on price. If I were to change this event for a larger amount of events, I would divide the events into sections by location and only look at the closer selections until we have the 5 events we need. Overall if I were to continue on this project I would work on adding times and interests to the events to create better search functions. 


How to Run the Program:

Need python 2.7

python tickets.py

type in your location


Sample Output:

Please Input Coordinates 
2,3
Event 4 - $30.00, Distance 7
Event 1 - $3.04, Distance 9
Event 5 - $2.00, Distance 10
Event 8 - $10.00, Distance 14
Event 7 - $50.00, Distance 17
